    "# WeRateDogs data wrangling exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Jose María Prieto - Udacity student\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your goal: \n",
    "wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. \n",
    "Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing \n",
    "and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "- Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "- Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "- The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "- You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Your tasks in this project are as follows:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gathering data\n",
    "- Assessing data\n",
    "- Cleaning data\n",
    "- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data\n",
    "- Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "__Gathering data__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Gather each of the following three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled wrangle_act.ipynb:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. Download this file manually: twitter_archive_enhanced.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count. Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Assessing Data for this Project__\n",
    "\n",
    "- After gathering each of the above pieces of data, assess them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. Detect and document at least eight **(8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues** in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. To meet specifications, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation (see the Key Points header on the previous page) must be assessed.\n",

To meet specifications, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation (see the Key Points header on the previous page) must be assessed.\n",
    "__Cleaning Data for this Project__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing. Perform this cleaning in wrangle_act.ipynb as well. The result should be a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame (or DataFrames, if appropriate). Again, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation must be cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately. Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze and visualize your wrangled data in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. **At least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization** must be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Reporting for this Project__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.html that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.\n",

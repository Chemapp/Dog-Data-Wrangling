    "# Wrangle Report\n",
    "\n",
    "During the wrangling process I have been able to put together the main issues that shall allow to make a preliminary analysis of the gathered data, with some interesting information about the preferences in terms of dog type popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nevertheless a lot potential improvement on the Assessment side, and even with several iterations on the data we could´ve improve the quality of the extraction and the captures of elements like names, that could give us some info about the type of popular names for dogs, or a review to the dog screening, as it seems not to be very precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used the 3 sources of data, although I couldn´t use the Twitter API since I still don´t have an answer from twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the identified issues founded during the assessment of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "A. **`tweets_archive`** table: \n",
    "    1. **rating_denominator** is 10 most of the time but there are few times with other values: 24/7s, 9/11s,1/2s,7/11s and then when there are multiple dogs they sum up the count \n",
    "    2. **rating_numerator** is usually between 1-15 but some values are out of scale\n",
    "    3. **Source** values are pieces of html code and are essentially 4 types (Iphone,Vine,tweet_web and TweetDeck)\n",
    "    4. 181 retweets (**retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp**)\n",
    "    5. 78 replies (**in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id**)\n",
    "    6. 2297 tweets with expanded_urls (links to images) 59 NaNs\n",
    "    7. 279 tweets that doesn´t contain a photo, some others contains (82) a Video or a vine (103) \n",
    "    8. The timestamps fields are strings not timedate (object)\n",
    "    9. In the name column there are 745 where the name of the dog was not captured, also 55 captured \"a\", and others like \"the\", \"an\" as names, fortunatelly names are put with capital letter so we can try to clean it later (109 of them to fix).\n",
    "    \n",
    "B.  **`Predictions`** table: \n",
    "\n",
    "    11. some values are not dog breeds(carousel) because were note recognised (p1_dog is False)- should be dropped\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness\n",
    "\n",
    "A. **`tweets_archive`** table: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Four variables in one columns in `tweets` table (Doggo, floofer, pupper and puppo in one single column)\n",
    "    2. Retweet columns are not the focus of the case and those can be dropped (retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp)\n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "B. **`Predictions`** table\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. non descriptive column names\n",
    "    \n",
    "C. **`tweet_API`** table\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Name of id to tweet_id to be inline with others\n",
    "    5. Many columns not necessary that can be dropped\n",
    "    6. Many columns are variables already captured in the other dataframes\n",
    "    \n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Out of the above the following issues are to be corrected:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8 Quality issues to be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. On `tweets_archive` drop the **retweets** entries.\n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` clean **Source** values on just 4 types (Iphone,Vine,tweet_web and TweetDeck) \n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` clean to leave only photos on the **expanded_urls**\n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` Fix formats of **timestamps** fields\n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` Clean **Dog names** colums to avoid conjuntion and articles instead of the names\n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` **Fill Nan** on the none to be considered as missing values.\n",
    "   - On `Predictions` Clean the **breeds not identified** that comes with objects instead of dog stage\n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` cleaning values on **rating Numerator and denominator** for one dog and a group of them.    \n",
    "   - On `tweets_archive` cleaning values of **ratings** when it has been wrongly parsed due to other x/y text found on the tweet.\n",
    "#### 3 of Tidiness to be addressed:\n",
    "   1. On `tweets_archive` Fix There are 4 columns for dog stages (doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo)\n",
    "   2. On `Predictions` fix names of columns to be descriptive.\n",
    "   3. On `tweet_API` drop unnecessary columns.\n",
